      "bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\n",

      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\n",
      "was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\n",
      "earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\n",
      "bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\n",
      "sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\n",
      "moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\n",
      "was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\n",
      "sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\n",
      "away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\n",
      "say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\n",
      "it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\n",
      "corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\n",
      "hanging from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\n",
      "and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\n",
      "other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\n",
      "wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\n",
      "solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\n",
      "and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\n",
      "doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\n",
      "the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\n",
      "them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\n",
      "curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\n",
      "door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\n",
      "in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\n",
      "passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\n",
      "looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\n",
      "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\n",
      "among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\n",
      "she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\n",
      "my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\n",
      "very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\n",
      "I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\n",
      "know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\n",
      "had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\n",
      "things indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\n",
      "went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\n",
      "it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\n",
      "telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\n",
      "certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\n",
      "of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\n",
      "beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\n",
      "Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\n",
      "first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\n",
      "for she had read several nice little histories about children who\n",
      "had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\n",
      "things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\n",
      "their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\n",
      "will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\n",
      "never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n",
      "`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\n",
      "later.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\n",
      "to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\n",
      "of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\n",
      "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\n",
      "it off.\n",

      "  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\n",
      "like a telescope.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\n",
      "her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\n",
      "size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.\n",
      "First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\n",
      "going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\n",
      "this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\n",
      "going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be\n",
      "like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\n",
      "like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\n",
      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\n",
      "on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when\n",
      "she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden\n",
      "key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she\n",
      "could not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly\n",
      "through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the\n",
      "legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had\n",
      "tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and\n",
      "cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\n",
      "herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\n",
      "She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\n",
      "seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\n",
      "severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\n",
      "trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\n",
      "of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\n",
      "child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\n",
      "use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\n",
      "there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\n",
      "person!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\n",
      "the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\n",
      "which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\n",
      "`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\n",
      "I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\n",
      "under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\n",
      "don't care which happens!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\n",
      "way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\n",
      "feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\n",
      "find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally\n",
      "happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\n",
      "way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\n",
      "that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\n",

      "making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\n",
      "again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\n",

      "slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\n",
      "thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\n",

      "out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\n",
      "wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about\n",
      "by mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that\n",
      "rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,\n",

      "spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not\n",
      "get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\n",
      "and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\n",
      "just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something\n",
      "of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are\n",

      "I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it\n",
      "away!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear\n",
      "whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer\n",
      "honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\n",
      "last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in\n",
      "the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more\n",
      "sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there\n",
      "must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\n",
      "pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I\n",
      "don't want to stay in here any longer!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at\n",
      "last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\n",
      "good many voice all talking together:  she made out the words:\n",
      "`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\n",
      "Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up\n",

      "narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and\n",
      "waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what\n",
      "sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close\n",
      "above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one\n",
      "sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes\n",
      "Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the\n",
      "hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold\n",
      "up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?\n",

      "Dinah at you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\n",
      "sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\n",
      "began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A\n",
      "barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\n",
      "doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came\n",
      "rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\n",
      "`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\n",
      "`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\n",
      "turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\n",
      "idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she\n",
      "thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it\n",
      "can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I\n",
      "suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find\n",
      "that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\n",
      "enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\n",
      "found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\n",
      "The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by\n",
      "two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\n",
      "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she\n",
      "ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\n",
      "thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\n",
      "and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\n",
      "I think that will be the best plan.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\n",
      "simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the\n",
      "smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering\n",
      "about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over\n",
      "her head made her look up in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round\n",
      "eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\n",
      "`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\n",
      "hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\n",
      "time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\n",
      "would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of\n",
      "stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\n",
      "into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,\n",
      "and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice\n",
      "dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\n",
      "over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\n",
      "made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\n",
      "its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very\n",
      "like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\n",
      "again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\n",
      "stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long\n",
      "way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat\n",
      "down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\n",
      "mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\n",
      "so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out\n",
      "of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the\n",
      "distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she\n",
      "leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself\n",
      "with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks\n",
      "very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh\n",

      "about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very\n",
      "politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and\n",
      "being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the\n",
      "conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's\n",
      "making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,\n",
      "very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not\n",
      "think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in\n",
      "a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something\n",
      "important to say!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.\n",

      "  `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as\n",
      "she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else\n",
      "to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth\n",
      "hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but\n",
      "at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth\n",
      "again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as\n",
      "I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, I've tried to say \"HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\" but it\n",
      "all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice folded her hands, and began:--\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,\n",
      "      `And your hair has become very white;\n",
      "    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\n",
      "      Do you think, at your age, it is right?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,\n",
      "      `I feared it might injure the brain;\n",
      "    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\n",
      "      Why, I do it again and again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,\n",
      "      And have grown most uncommonly fat;\n",
      "    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\n",
      "      Pray, what is the reason of that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n",
      "      `I kept all my limbs very supple\n",
      "    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\n",
      "      Allow me to sell you a couple?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak\n",
      "      For anything tougher than suet;\n",
      "    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--\n",
      "      Pray how did you manage to do it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,\n",
      "      And argued each case with my wife;\n",
      "    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n",
      "      Has lasted the rest of my life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose\n",
      "      That your eye was as steady as ever;\n",
      "    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\n",
      "      What made you so awfully clever?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'\n",
      "      Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!\n",

      "words have got altered.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar\n",
      "decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\n",

      "  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in\n",
      "her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you\n",
      "wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched\n",
      "height to be.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar\n",
      "angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three\n",
      "inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.\n",

      "easily offended!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it\n",
      "put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.\n",
      "In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its\n",
      "mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got\n",
      "down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely\n",
      "remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and\n",
      "the other side will make you grow shorter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had\n",
      "asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a\n",
      "minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as\n",
      "it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.\n",
      "However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they\n",
      "would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a\n",
      "little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment\n",
      "she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her\n",
      "foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but\n",
      "she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking\n",
      "rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.\n",
      "Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was\n",
      "hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and\n",
      "managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\n",
      "\n",

      "  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of\n",
      "delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she\n",
      "found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could\n",
      "see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which\n",
      "seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay\n",
      "far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where\n",
      "HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I\n",
      "can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no\n",
      "result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the\n",
      "distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her\n",
      "head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted\n",
      "to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,\n",
      "like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a\n",
      "graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which\n",
      "she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she\n",
      "had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a\n",
      "hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating\n",
      "her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more\n",
      "subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every\n",
      "way, and nothing seems to suit them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've\n",
      "tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but\n",
      "those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no\n",
      "use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the\n",
      "Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and\n",
      "day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was\n",
      "beginning to see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued\n",
      "the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was\n",
      "thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come\n",
      "wriggling down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'm\n",
      "a--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can see you're\n",
      "trying to invent something!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\n",
      "remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the\n",
      "deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my\n",
      "time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a\n",
      "serpent; and there's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be\n",
      "telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very\n",
      "truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as\n",
      "serpents do, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why\n",
      "then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent\n",
      "for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of\n",
      "adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and\n",
      "what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a\n",
      "serpent?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm\n",
      "not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't\n",
      "want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it\n",
      "settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the\n",
      "trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\n",
      "among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\n",
      "untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the\n",
      "pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very\n",
      "carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\n",
      "growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,\n",
      "that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a\n",
      "few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,\n",
      "there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes\n",
      "are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to\n",
      "another!  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next\n",
      "thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be\n",
      "done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an\n",
      "open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n",
      "`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come\n",
      "upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their\n",
      "wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did\n",
      "not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself\n",

      "with his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,\n",
      "with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,\n",

      "\n",
      "  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great\n",
      "letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to\n",
      "the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.  An\n",
      "invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman\n",
      "repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the\n",
      "words a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess\n",
      "to play croquet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled\n",
      "together.\n",

      "\n",
      "  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\n",
      "that for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\n",
      "door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise\n",
      "inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was\n",
      "a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling\n",
      "and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\n",
      "or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",

      "on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\n",
      "instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\n",
      "you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time\n",
      "he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\n",
      "perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so\n",
      "VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\n",
      "answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\n",

      "  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate\n",
      "came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just\n",
      "grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees\n",
      "behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,\n",

      "much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to\n",
      "beat time when I learn music.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand\n",
      "beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do\n",
      "almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose\n",
      "it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:\n",
      "you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the\n",
      "clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a\n",
      "whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:\n",
      "`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep\n",
      "it to half-past one as long as you liked.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.\n",
      "`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'\n",
      "(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the\n",
      "great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "            \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "            How I wonder what you're at!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "            \"Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "            Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "                    Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n",
      "`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that\n",
      "they had to pinch it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,\n",
      "`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the\n",
      "time!  Off with his head!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,\n",
      "`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so\n",
      "many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always\n",
      "tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice\n",
      "ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,\n",
      "yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady\n",
      "tells us a story.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at\n",
      "the proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,\n",
      "Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he\n",
      "said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows\n",
      "were saying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep\n",
      "again before it's done.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the\n",
      "Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,\n",
      "Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great\n",
      "interest in questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a\n",
      "minute or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently\n",
      "remarked; `they'd have been ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways\n",
      "of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went\n",
      "on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very\n",
      "earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so\n",
      "I can't take more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very\n",
      "easy to take MORE than nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked\n",
      "triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped\n",
      "herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the\n",
      "Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the\n",
      "bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and\n",
      "then said, `It was a treacle-well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but\n",
      "the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse\n",
      "sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the\n",
      "story for yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt\n",
      "again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he\n",
      "consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they\n",
      "were learning to draw, you know--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move\n",
      "one place on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the\n",
      "March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather\n",
      "unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the\n",
      "only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a\n",
      "good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset\n",
      "the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began\n",
      "very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw\n",
      "the treacle from?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so\n",
      "I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,\n",
      "stupid?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not\n",
      "choosing to notice this last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse\n",
      "go on for some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and\n",
      "rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew\n",
      "all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why with an M?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why not?' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going\n",
      "off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up\n",
      "again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an\n",
      "M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--\n",
      "you know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever\n",
      "see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I\n",
      "don't think--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got\n",
      "up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep\n",
      "instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her\n",
      "going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that\n",
      "they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were\n",
      "trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she\n",

      "ever was at in all my life!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a\n",

      "said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and\n",
      "unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to\n",
      "work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her\n",
      "pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the\n",

      "\n",
      "  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped\n",
      "like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and\n",
      "feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\n",
      "ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\n",
      "soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were\n",
      "ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\n",
      "in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next\n",
      "came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\n",
      "recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\n",
      "manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",
      "noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\n",
      "King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\n",
      "grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\n",
      "her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember\n",

      "what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people\n",

      "reply.\n",

      "was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\n",

      "\n",
      "  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a\n",

      "and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up\n",
      "against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or\n",
      "two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a\n",
      "curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and\n",
      "furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live\n",
      "flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\n",
      "stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",

      "out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it\n",
      "WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a\n",
      "puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\n",
      "and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\n",
      "it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,\n",
      "there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers\n",
      "were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\n",
      "ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very\n",
      "difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,\n",
      "quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in\n",
      "a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went\n",
      "stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with\n",
      "her head!' about once in a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as\n",
      "yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might\n",
      "happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of\n",
      "me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great\n",
      "wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering\n",
      "whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a\n",
      "curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at\n",
      "first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to\n",
      "be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I\n",
      "shall have somebody to talk to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was\n",
      "mouth enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no\n",
      "use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at\n",
      "least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,\n",
      "and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the\n",
      "game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The\n",
      "Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and\n",
      "no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather\n",
      "a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't\n",
      "hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in\n",
      "particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and\n",
      "you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;\n",
      "for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next\n",
      "walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have\n",
      "croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it\n",
      "saw mine coming!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then\n",
      "she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so\n",
      "she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while\n",
      "finishing the game.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and\n",
      "looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me\n",
      "to introduce it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:  `however,\n",
      "it may kiss my hand if it likes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me\n",
      "like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in\n",
      "some book, but I don't remember where.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and\n",
      "he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I\n",
      "wish you would have this cat removed!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great\n",
      "or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking\n",
      "round.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and\n",
      "he hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game\n",
      "was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,\n",
      "screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three\n",
      "of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and\n",
      "she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in\n",
      "such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or\n",
      "not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,\n",
      "which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one\n",
      "of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her\n",
      "flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where\n",
      "Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up\n",
      "into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,\n",
      "the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:\n",
      "`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches\n",
      "are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away\n",
      "under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for\n",
      "a little more conversation with her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to\n",
      "find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute\n",
      "going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who\n",
      "were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,\n",
      "and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to\n",
      "settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,\n",
      "though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed\n",
      "to make out exactly what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a\n",
      "head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had\n",

      "at HIS time of life.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a\n",

      "\n",
      "  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,\n",
      "because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was\n",
      "exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,\n",
      "and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not\n",
      "like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",

      "anxious to have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of\n",
      "that is--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like it put\n",
      "more simply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than\n",

      "beginning to feel a little worried.\n",
      "\n",

      "fly; and the m--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died\n",
      "away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the\n",

      "\n",
      "  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,\n",
      "and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,\n",

      "moment's delay would cost them their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off\n",

      "taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave\n",
      "off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour\n",
      "or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the\n",
      "King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of\n",
      "execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to\n",
      "Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his\n",
      "history,'\n",
      "\n",
      "  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low\n",
      "voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,\n",
      "THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite\n",
      "unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the\n",
      "sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)\n",
      "`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to\n",
      "see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and\n",
      "see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,\n",
      "leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like\n",
      "the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would\n",
      "be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage\n",
      "Queen:  so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the\n",
      "Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'\n",
      "said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they\n",
      "never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went\n",
      "slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,\n",
      "never!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\n",
      "distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\n",
      "as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart\n",
      "would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she\n",
      "asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the\n",
      "same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got\n",
      "no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with\n",
      "large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to\n",
      "know your history, she do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow\n",
      "tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've\n",
      "finished.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice\n",
      "thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he\n",
      "doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was\n",
      "a real Turtle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only\n",
      "by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and\n",
      "the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very\n",
      "nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your\n",
      "interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be\n",
      "more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more\n",
      "calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to\n",
      "school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call\n",
      "him Tortoise--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock\n",
      "Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\n",
      "question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and\n",
      "looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At\n",
      "last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!\n",
